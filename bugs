a "Fatal Python error: PyEval_RestoreThread: NULL tstate" can occur when starting the VideoCapture (at startup or when swapping
detection tools from the GUI).
when clicking on an already running process in the menu, it restarts it. seems a bit extreme, maybe do nothing -- won't fix for now
the save changes dialog doesn't show up when hitting CMD+Q  -- won't fix :Â this seems to be a pain with Tkinter, no time for that
