remove (or clear) stonesfinder window when the boardfinder does not provide any board location
when clicking on an already running process in the menu, it restarts it. seems a bit extreme, maybe do nothing

the save changes dialog doesn't show up when hitting CMD+Q
boardfinder manual listen very rarely to 'q', makes program annoying to kill
