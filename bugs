bugs
a "Fatal Python error: PyEval_RestoreThread: NULL tstate" can occur. I believe this is due to the fact that openCV
cv2.show() must be run on the main thread, together with Tkinter in this case.
A workaround to that, on my machine at least, was to force the reduction of images display frequency. This bug is most
likely very dependant on available CPU, so contributors may increase/uncap display frequency without any trouble.

when clicking on an already running process in the menu, it restarts it. seems a bit extreme, maybe do nothing -- won't fix for now
the save changes dialog doesn't show up when hitting CMD+Q  -- won't fix :Â this seems to be a pain with Tkinter, no time for that.

the manual board finder doesn't listen to "correction" click on the first image. It seems to be related to startup, because
it works fine if no location has been saved (only bugs when the 4 points are shown at startup).
